    <p><center><strong>Information Statement for the Research Project: <br>Users Perceptions and the Design of Avatars: A Survey Study</strong></br></center></p>
    <p>You are invited to participate in the research project identified above which is being conducted by Hussain Al Jaroodi.
      The research is part of Hussain’s PhD studies at the University of Newcastle, supervised by Dr Raymond Chiong and Dr Marc Adam,
      from the School of Electrical Engineering and Computing.</p>
    <P><font size="5" color="green">Why is the research being done?</font></P>
    <p>The purpose of the research is to design avatars for users from Arabic cultures.
      Understanding how avatars influence users will
      help designers to create effective and engaging Avatars for Arabic users.
      The research is about Human-Centred Information Systems (HCIS), where the design of a system should always be developed on the basis of users’ needs and requirements.
      The questions will involve the perception of physical and psychological similarity between users and avatars, social presence which could make users feel like it is face-to-face interaction, how avatars are represented to be similar to human beings,
      how avatars are perceived to be culturally appropriate for Arabic users, do avatars appear familiar to users from Arabic culture, and intention to use or the likelihood of using the avatar in mHealth applications for example, physical activity or healthy diet.
       So far, the majority of research in this area has looked into avatars in the Western context, and there is limited research on whether avatars would have to be designed differently for Arabic users.</p>
